This is a relationship that is easy to take for granted. Often students are simply taught how to find an anti-derivative, and then told the fact that the difference between the value of that anti-derivative at two points gives the signed area under the initial curve. This is expressed as:</p><p><span class="math display">\[\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\]</span></p><p>I want to explore why this is true on an intuitive level, as opposed to presenting a rigorous proof that new calculus students would learn to regurgitate. To begin, let's consider the area under the function <span class="math inline">\(\sin(x)\)</span> on the interval <span class="math inline">\([0, \pi]\)</span>. On the plot below I have also included the anti-derivative of <span class="math inline">\(\sin(x)\)</span> being <span class="math inline">\(-\cos(x)\)</span>. Our goal here is to understand why the area shaded in red, <span class="math inline">\(\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(x)\)</span>, is equal to the difference in height between the two red points, <span class="math inline">\(-\cos(\pi) - -\cos(0) = 2\)</span></p><img src="../../images/ftoc1.jpg"><p>There are a few ways we can approach trying to find the area. One such approach is to work backwards from the average value of the function. Consider a transformation of our shaded area into a rectangle where the width is the same, but the height is equal to the average value of the function.</p><img src="../../images/ftoc2.jpg"><p>The width of this rectangle is known, but then to calculate the area we'd need to know the average value of <span class="math inline">\(\sin(x)\)</span> across that interval. To figure this out, let's use the known relationship to the anti-derivative, since we know that's ultimately where we need to end up. Since <span class="math inline">\(\sin(x)\)</span> is the gradient function of <span class="math inline">\(-\cos(x)\)</span>, the average value of <span class="math inline">\(\sin(x)\)</span> is equal to the average gradient of <span class="math inline">\(-\cos(x)\)</span>. That average gradient across the interval is equal to the gradient of the secant across that domain, which is the difference in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> divided by the difference in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of our red endpoints.</p><img src="../../images/ftoc3.jpg"><p>When we multiply this average value by the width of the interval to get the area, we are simply left with the difference in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> of our two endpoints, which is the anti-derivative evaluated at the endpoints.</p></article></div></div></main><footer><p>By Aaron Manning</p><p><a href="#">Back to top</a></p></footer></body></html>
