                                Hello traveller across the internet. You have stumbled across my mathematics blog, so welcome! Ultimately, I post something here because something has been on my mind about maths education, I've come across a beautiful problem worth sharing, or I want to explore a given topic and approaches to explaining and understanding it. The name stars and bars comes from a simple yet very elegant approach to the combinatorics problem of combinations with reputation, which I believe illustrates how considering a new perspective on a problem can turn it from something complex and confusing to be intuitive, immediately understandable and beautiful. If you're new here, I would recommend reading <a href="posts/what-does-area-have-to-do-with-gradient/">this post here</a> to start. <!--If you have no interest in mathematics whatsoever, but you're willing to give me some of your time, then I would recommend <a href="#">this one</a>-->. If you'd like to provide me with any feedback, or argue with me over a controversial opinion I have expressed, send me an email <a href="mailto:contact@aaronmanning.net">here</a>. I hope you enjoy :)
