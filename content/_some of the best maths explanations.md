## Some of the best maths explanations

As someone keenly interested in mathematics and its intersection with hands off education, there are few things more satisfying that an excellent explanation of a mathematical concept. As such, this post is a bit of a collection of some of the best books, papers, articles and videos explaining concepts in mathematics.

This post will be a little different in the sense that I plan on coming back to and updating it in the future, as I come across more great explanations to add.

### Grant and Sal's Multi-Variable Calculus Series on Khan Academy

### Visual Complex Analysis by Tristan Needham

### 3Blue1Brown - Differential Equations

### BlackPenRedPen - The Intriguing i^(4/4)
