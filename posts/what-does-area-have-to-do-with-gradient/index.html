                                    The first fundamental theorem of calculus makes an interesting claim about the relationship between the area under a curve, and the anti-derivative of that curve's corresponding function. This is a relationship that is easy to take for granted. Often students are simply taught how to find an anti-derivative and then told the fact that the difference between the value of that anti-derivative at two points gives the area under the initial curve. This is expressed as:
                                </p>
    
                                <p class="math display">
                                    \[
                                        \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
                                    \]
                                </p>
    
                                <p>
                                    I want to explore why this is true on an intuitive level, as opposed to presenting a rigorous proof that new calculus students would learn to regurgitate. To begin, let's consider the area under the function <span class="math inline">\(\sin(x)\)</span> on the interval <span class="math inline">\([0, \pi]\)</span>. On the plot below I have also included the anti-derivative <span class="math inline">\(-\cos(x)\)</span>. Examining the first fundamental theorem of calculus, our goal here being to understand why the area shaded in red, <span class="math inline">\(\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(x)\)</span>, is equal to the difference in height between the two red points, <span class="math inline">\(-\cos(\pi) - -\cos(0)\)</span>.
                                </p>
    
                                <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/epprqxdhur" width="100%" style="min-height:400px"></iframe>
    
                                <p>
                                    There are a few ways we can approach trying to find the area. One such approach is to work backwards from the average value of the function. Consider a transformation of our shaded area into a rectangle where the width is the same, but the height is equal to the average value of the function.
                                </p>
    
                                <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/c9poivd99d" width="100%" style="min-height:400px"></iframe>
    
                                <p>
                                    The width of this rectangle is known, but then to calculate the area we'd need to know the average value of <span class="math inline">\(\sin(x)\)</span> across that interval. To figure this out, let's use the known relationship to the anti-derivative, since we know that's ultimately where we need to end up. Since <span class="math inline">\(\sin(x)\)</span> is the gradient function of <span class="math inline">\(-\cos(x)\)</span>, the average value of <span class="math inline">\(\sin(x)\)</span> is equal to the average gradient of <span class="math inline">\(-\cos(x)\)</span>. That average gradient across the interval is equal to the gradient of the secant across that domain, which is the difference in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> divided by the difference in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of our red endpoints.
                                </p>
    
                                <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cffzhaqzie" width="100%" style="min-height:400px"></iframe>
                                
                                <p>
                                    When we multiply this average value by the width of the interval to get the area, we are simply left with the difference in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> of our two endpoints, which is the anti-derivative evaluated at the endpoints.
                                </p>
