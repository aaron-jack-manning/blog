Blog

This repository contains the HTML and CSS source for [my blog](https://blog.aaronmanning.net).

## Site Content

The latest version of the site itself, as hosted, can be found in `site-generation/website` folder. Note that the HTML provided in that folder is autogenerated and not neatly formatted to be human read.

## Dependencies and Links

The site generation code has a dependency on my custom standard library for OCaml which can be found [here](https://github.com/aaron-jack-manning/ocaml-standard-library), and on an HTML DSL that I wrote which can be found [here](https://github.com/aaron-jack-manning/ocaml-html-dsl).

A lot of the images generated for the blog are drawn using a tool I created called [Mathil](https://github.com/aaron-jack-manning/mathil). The source code for the images can be found in the `image-source-code` folder.

If you are interested in using the computer modern LaTeX font on a website just as I did, [this](https://checkmyworking.com/cm-web-fonts/) is a great resource.
